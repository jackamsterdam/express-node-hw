# Home exercise - nodejs path params

1. Create nodejs 'express' server
2. The server will listen to port 3000
3. Add 'get' API, When I will open a browser (Chrome) and set the following url with the url param:
   'http://localhost:3000/1978' I will get text response: 'You whare born in 1978'

-   You can read the path params from the 'req.params'
