# Home exercise - nodejs get/post

1. Create nodejs 'express' server
2. The server will listen to port 3000
3. Add 'get' root API (http://localhost:3000), When I will get to this url I'll get an HTML file as follow:

    - The HTML file will include the following:
        1. 3 inputs for: firstName, lastName, id
        2. 1 button
        3. When I will press on the button I expect the firstName, lastName, id will be send by 'post' method as an json object to the server to the following url: http://localhost:3000/persons
        - To do 'post' to the server use the 'fetch' function

4. Add 'post' '/persons' API (http://localhost:3000/persons), When I will post to this url, the income object will be pushed to an array (this array will be define ion the server: const personsArray = [])

5. Add 'get' '/persons/:id' API (http://localhost:3000/persons/<id>), When I will get to this url, I will get json response with the person that have this supplied id, you supposed to find is inside the personsArray, in case it doesn't exist return empty object {} or object with message {message: 'This person doesn't exist' }
